## Introduction ##

Do you have questions about using RDF/OWL for biodiversity data that you would like answered by the Task Group? Ask them here.

Do you have questions about the group itself? You can ask those to.

Depending on when they're asked, these questions will help to define the agenda of one or more of the kickoff meeting in New Orleans; follow-up workshop; and email discussion.

## Example 1 ##

Is this my first question?
