# Taxon Concepts Landing Page #

This page contains links to various documents related to taxon concepts

**Disambiguation:** this page is NOT about the TaxonConcept Ontology (http://www.taxonconcept.org/) which is compared to other biodiversity ontologies [here](BiodiversityOntologies#3_The_TaxonConcept_Ontology.md), diagrammed [here](TaxonConceptOntologyDiagrams.md), and whose object properties are used in an example of the Darwin Core RDF Guide [here](DwcRdfExamplesTaxonConcept.md).

[Summary and links to a thread related to TCS and Taxon Concepts](TCSthread.md)

An email thread from about 2012-11 to 2012-12 which started off as a discussion of the TDWG TCS Standard and ended up on a discussion of the TaxonConcept Ontology of the TDWG Ontologies

[RDF representation of a tc:TaxonConcept? instance and its associated reference](TCSBasedTaxon.md)

This document was produced following an extended email discussion about the meaning of taxon concepts in the context of RDF.  It contains (among other things) a diagram which graphically represents a taxon concept.  It also includes examples in RDF/XML and RDF/Turtle.

[Describing Taxon Concepts as RDF](TaxonInRDF.md)

This is an ancillary document associated with the Darwin Core RDF Guide.  The Darwin Core RDF Guide recommends against using the dwc:Taxon class terms to construct taxon concept instances (although they can be used as convenience properties).  This document provides suggestions for using terms outside of Darwin Core (i.e. the non-standard TDWG TaxonConcept and TaxonName ontology terms) to construct taxon concept or taxon name use (TNU) instances.  This document was informed by the TCS/TaxonConcept ontology thread (linked above) and the TCS-based taxon diagram (linked above).

[Notes and email references on the taxon class](http://code.google.com/p/darwin-sw/wiki/ClassTaxon)

This is a (somewhat outdated) page from the Darwin-SW website which contains a lot of links to emails and references to various points of view related to taxa and taxon concepts.  There is a somewhat abbreviated version of this [here](DarwinCoreClasses#The_dwc:Taxon_class.md).
