# Thread Summaries #

This is a list of attempts to summarize some important discussions that have happened on the task group's email list

[Discussion about the Open Annotation (OA) data model](OAThread.md)

This thread discusses the relationship between the OA model, the Darwin Core ResourceRelationship terms, and the TDWG TaxonConcept Ontology.  It led to the creation of [a page](ResourceRelationship.md) in the ancillary documents associated with the Darwin Core RDF Guide.  However, Paul Morris does not believe (2013-11) this is a correct usage of the OA model.

[Email thread on TCS and Taxon Concepts](TCSthread.md)

This thread which took place on the TDWG TAG and TDWG RDF Task Group email lists discusses the use of TCS and the TDWG TaxonConcept Ontology.  See also [this page](TaxonConcepts.md) which contains links to other documents about taxon concepts.
