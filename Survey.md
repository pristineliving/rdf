## Background ##

There are two goals to this survey, both of which will inform and guide task group activity:
  1. to determine what TDWG (i.e. you) wants the RDF/OWL task group to work on.
  1. to understand the "state of the semantic web in TDWG", by inventorying classes and properties being used; identifiers being used; sparql endpoints and data dumps available; and projects' near-term plans.

Please answer these questions by entering a comment (or multiple comments below). (You'll need to be signed in to your Google account.)


### Expectations ###
**1.** What would you like to see the group focus on? (Possibilities discussed in New Orleans included guidelines for using RDF in the TDWG arena; a domain model for TDWG; an RDF playpen/sandbox for experimenting with a variety of approaches; responding to [Rod Page's challenge](http://iphylo.blogspot.com/2011/10/tdwg-challenge-what-is-rdf-good-for.html); and assisting in the broader interpretation and/or representation of existing standards.)

**2.** Do you have any current issues that you hope this new group will help solve?


### Current Practices ###
**3.** Are you currently using, or do you have immediate plans to use RDF? If yes, can you give a brief description of the data being served, and/or provide links to:
  * sources of data (data dumps, SPARQL endpoints, etc.),
  * design documents or project proposals,
  * a bubble diagram (or even just a list) of the classes and properties you are using (with namespaces, of course),
  * a list of classes and properties that you need but that are not readily available,
  * anything elses that would shed light on what you're up to?

**4.** What identifiers are you using?  (Includes taxa, people, institutions, protected areas, etc.)
