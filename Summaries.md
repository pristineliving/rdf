# Landing page for use cases, competency questions, class inventory, examples, etc. #

[Use Case collection](UseCases.md)

This use case collection was originally assembled in preparation for the May 2012 Semantics of Biodiversity workshop.  Additional examples have been added since then.

[Darwin Core-related competency questions](CompetencyQuestions.md)

A collection of competency questions related to Darwin Core.

[Biodiversity RDF data in the wild](DataInventory.md)

Descriptions of RDF datasets "in the wild" with links to SPARQL endpoints. See also the [Rod Page's Challenge document](RodPageChallenge.md) which has some SPARQL query examples based on real frog data loaded into the task group's sandbox triplestores.

[Inventory of classes relevant to biodiversity informatics](ClassInventory.md)

This page summarizes classes defined by Dublin Core, Darwin Core, FOAF, and the TDWG Ontology.  It includes the DCMI and Dublin Core type vocabularies.

[Summary of discussions about the Darwin Core classes](DarwinCoreClasses.md)

This page contains links to many emails and documents which discuss the meaning of core classes in Darwin Core.

[Comparison of biodiversity ontologies](BiodiversityOntologies.md)

This document summarizes four vocabularies/ontologies which mint object properties that could be used to link instances of core classes in the biodiversity informatics domain. It includes diagrams which are color coded to show the similarities among the models.
